# Learn Tensorflow 

## Tensorflow
- Define structure
- Define loss
- Define optimizer
- Initialization

## Session
- run train
- run weight
- run biases
- Could be opened by with 
- Why session? Still don't understand

## Variable
- What's the meaning of Variable?
- What's the meaning of Session?
- Kind of understand what happens. But not sure why it should be initialized like this.
- Feeds?

## Placeholder
- Data from outside will need to use this.

## Activation function
- Not hard. But I'm getting confused....
- Stop at the end of Tensorflow 10 of Morvan's clips.


## Now 0410  13:58 2018. Not sure what the above is.
## Probably needs to record a lot.
- But it's just a pattern. The most important part is not framework. It's the model!
- Just a lot of API.
- Similar to Verilog
