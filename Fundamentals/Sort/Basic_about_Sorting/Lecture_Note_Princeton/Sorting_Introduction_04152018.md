# Sorting Introduction

## Interface
- Generic sort relies on Comparable Interface. 
- Each type should implement CompareTo. ( Callback mechanism)
- The CompareTo should follow total order and output negative, 0,plus if it's smaller, equal and larger than the other.
- Each sort algorithm should target Comparable Interface.
